App Dev Cloud with JBoss Cool Store Demo 
==========================================
This demo is to install JBoss Cool Store in the Cloud based on leveraging any Red Hat OpenShift container
based platform. It delivers a fully functioning containerized JBoss Cool Store.

The Cool Store is a retail web store demo where you will find rules, decision tables, events, and a ruleflow 
that is leveraged by a web application. The web application is a WAR built using the JBoss BRMS
generated project as a dependency, providing an example project showing how developers can focus on the 
application code while the business analysts can focus on rules, events, and ruleflows in the 
JBoss BRMS product web based dashboard.

This demo is self contained, it uses a custom maven settings to deploy all built JBoss BRMS knowledge artifacts
into an external maven repository (not your local repository), in /tmp/maven-repo.


Install JBoss Cool Store on OpenShift
-------------------------------------
1. (OPTIONAL) First ensure you have an OpenShift container based installation, such as one of the followling installed first:

  - [OCP Install Demo](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo)

  - [Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK) using Minishift](https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview)

  - or your own OpenShift installation.

2. [Download and unzip this demo.](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/rhcs-coolstore-demo/archive/master.zip)

3. Download JBoss EAP & JBoss BRMS, add to installs directory (see installs/README).

4. Run 'init.sh' or 'init.bat' file. 'init.bat' must be run with Administrative privileges:
```
   # The installation needs to be pointed to a running version
   # of OpenShift, so pass an IP address such as:
   #
   $ ./init.sh 192.168.99.100  # example for OCP.
```

Login to Cool Store to start exploring a retail web shopping project (the address will be generated by the init script):

  - OCP example: http://rhcs-coolstore-demo-appdev-in-cloud.192.168.99.100.nip.io/business-central ( u:erics / p:jbossbrms1! )

  - OCP example web app: http://rhcs-coolstore-demo-appdev-in-cloud.192.168.99.100.nip.io/brms-coolstore-demo

Note before running demo:
-------------------------

Should your local network DNS not handle the resolution of the above address, giving you page not found errors, you can apply the
following to your local hosts file:

```
$ sudo vi /etc/hosts

# add host for OCP demo resulution
192.168.99.100   rhcs-coolstore-demo-appdev-in-cloud.192.168.99.100.nip.io 
```

-----

This project can be installed on any OpenShift platform, such as OpenShift Container Platform.
It's possible to install it on any available installation by pointing this installer to an OpenShift IP address:
```
  $ ./init.sh IP
```

-----

If for any reason the installation breaks or you want a new JBoss BRMS installation, just remove the project rhcs-brms-install-demo
entry in the OpenShift console and re-run the installation.

-----

To clone a repository in the running container, the following actions would need to occur from a developer's machine.

1. Execute port forwarding through the OpenShift CLI. This will open a tunnel between the developer's machine and the pod through
	 the OpenShift API pod proxy. The command window will block while the session is open:

   ```
   # Read-only access to repo on port 9418.
   #
   $ oc port-forward $(oc get pod -l=deploymentconfig=rhcs-coolstore-demo --template='{{ range .items }} {{ .metadata.name }} {{ end }}') 9418:9418

   # Read-write access to repo on port 8001.
   #
   $ oc port-forward $(oc get pod -l=deploymentconfig=rhcs-coolstore-demo --template='{{ range .items }} {{ .metadata.name }} {{ end }}') 8001:8001
   ```

2. Clone the repository. In another window, clone the remote repository:

   ```
   # Read-only access to repo on port 9418.
   #
   $ git clone git://localhost:9418/coolstore-demo

   # Read-write access to repo on port 8001.
   #
   $ git clone git://localhost:8001/coolstore-demo
   ```
